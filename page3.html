    <H2> 2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? </H2>
    <p> The tools I used were Trello, CSS, Github, HTML and Visual Studio Code. I was happy with the tools that I used because they served their functions as they should and fulfilled my digital needs. For example, Visual Studio Code and HTML ran the code for me in order to make the website work including all the text and images. I then used  CSS to position everything where I wanted it to be. CSS also allowed me to design the website with colour and other effects. Github allowed me to share code to a cloud, which enabled me to access my work from home. </p>
    <br>
    <h2> 2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate</h2>
    <p> In order to create my website, I have been using several IT tools such as Visual Studio Code, Trello, HTML and CSS. All of these tools were extremely beneficial in the way that I needed them to be for example, CSS enabled to change the style of and other visual attributes of my website. The visual features of my website play a big part in the websites design as iit has a green and orange theme, images that needed positioning and animations. Trello was also useful as I could keep on track if what I need to do and what had been completed, this avoids going back and forth or confusion. HTML enables my code to run a website so I can see if everything is working how it should.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>  2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change? </h2>
    <p> I would say the strengths of my website are that it doesn’t look messy or as if it has been rushed. Everything has been positioned and has purpose resulting in everything looking neat. I am happy with my website because it has everything I needed it to have and all the buttons work without any errors. The text is aligned but the sub-titles are centered, how I wanted it to be. Also there are no bugs that result in anything being out of place. If I had to change something I would maybe have several pictures on the homepage that if they are clicked on they each lead you to a different page, having the same role as a menu. </p>
    <br>
    <h2> 2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h2>
    <p> Another improvement I could make is a visit counter. This counts the number of users that visit the website in order to monitor user activity. This improvement should also include the ability to see what page the user is on and how long they have been on the website. Another major improvement that would require a lot of code is the ability to read user’s IP addresses in order to track where they are accessing the website from. This would make it even easier to monitor user activity as you could count how many times the same user visits the site and also what country they are from. Another reason why this may be beneficial is for security reasons, if any user tries to breach the website’s security for example then it would track them down and send a notification to the website owner.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>  2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h2>
    <p> I have looked over the outcomes and I can confidently say that they meet the requirements. This is because I have used the checklist and gone through all my pages and I have including the appropriate things in Visual Studio Code. I have also checked that my pages are error free and fit for purpose. In one of my pages I have included my first project that was a text-based game and even this runs error free and smoothly. This proves that the code doesn’t have any bugs and is fit for purpose.</p>
