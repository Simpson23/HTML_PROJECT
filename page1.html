      <h2> Unit 1 - Outcome 1</h2>
      <h2> 1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h2>
      <p>
          For the past few decades the world has continued to progress forward when it comes to technology. We have gone from the first mobile phone being bigger than a brick 
          to having 7 inch screens thinner than a human finger. Ultimately we have a mini - computer in our pockets as it can do almost anything we want it to from planning work 
          or calling people.  In today’s day and age nearly every business industry relies on computers and machines to help reduce business costs and increase production 
          efficiency. For example, on some motorways in the United Kingdom they have Starbucks drive-through at the service stations. Usually at these drive-throughs they have 
          Starbucks employees working there, but at some of them they have a machine that takes the order, then the payment and then has a tray system that sticks out in order to hand 
          the customer their drink. This is an example of where IT systems and coding has replaced a human that had a certain amount of functions and instructions. Another example is,
          
      in libraries or law/accounting firms instead of storing large amounts of files and folders (hard copies) that would take up physical space they have a bookkeeping software
          installed on computers or other electronic devices that may be networked together. There are several reasons that business are introducing IT into themselves. For example,
          to save money by replacing employees with technology that has been programmed to do a human’s job. Also, by using technology to complete certain jobs it may reduce the 
           chance of errors being made for example the wrong food order being given out at a food place.
      </p>
      <h2> 1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills? </h2>
      <p>
          I feel that in order to create a successful project teamwork is key. Only if the team communicates with each other and share advice with each other the project will turn out
           the best it can. Recently, me and a couple of other individuals created a game on Python and we only had basic knowledge of how to use it and create programmes.The team also 
           had basic knowledge on how to use Python and Visual Studio Code. Together they were able to create programmes such as text based games and print out text-art. The game required 
           approximately 600 lines of code and consisted of if/else statements, functions and simple print statements. 
      </p>
      <h2> 1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? </h2>
      <p>
          I will plan the way I will make my website by adding my tasks to <a href="https://trello.com/invite/b/2SXtTtgD/02463557a62ec365836b52ded9fe332b/website">my Trello board</a>. The main purpose of me doing this is so the whole project is more organised and I can track where I 
          am up to more easily. My Trello board has 3 sub-heading called ‘To Do’, ‘Doing’ and ‘Done’. These also make arranging/tracking things easier. I will add my primary tasks such
           as writing the text and preparing the code in the ‘To Do’ list as these are priority. 
      </p>
      <h2> 1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital
          projects to fail? Why? </h2>
      <p> There are many factors that could cause a digital project and we have had several examples of these over the years when it comes to tech-industry companies. For example,
           Samsung is one of the world’s leading to tech-companies especially when it comes to mobile phones, tablets and home electricals. Despite their almost golden reputation in
            the industry, they released a $2,000 foldable phone in April 2019. The company had been teasing this product for almost 12 months so they were expected to come out with 
            something that was reliable but as within the first couple of weeks of the product’s release many users were complaining and demanding refunds. [1] This is because half 
            the screen on the phone stopped working for most people, the others were experiencing other types of problems. This all comes down to the coding and programming of the 
            phone and this is one of the risks in digital projects, if the coding is not right there is chance of encountering error/problems.These risks are similar in all types 
            of digital projects for example, in codenation as part of my 3 week coding course myself and 2 others had to create a text - based game on a software called Python. 
            We had no experience at first but after some days we had the knowledge to complete our task. The game had to go through countless amounts of tests and came up with error
             after error but this is just part of the risks, if the code isn’t right it wont run. Several times my team members said they have completed the project and wanted me to 
             test it but I kept finding errors that they couldn’t as I was giving a user’s point of view.
      </p>
      <h2> 1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job? </h2>
      <p> When creating digital projects people often work in teams and they need a way to communicate with each other and share work where everyone stays up to date. 
          This is where software such as Github and Slack come into use. Slack is a software that is made for group conversations/channels and it allows you to share images,
          message individuals/team and share code. Github is a very similar service but is more dedicated to a team of people working on the same code from different devices.
          One team member can upload code to their Github user area and when another team member wants to edit or update something they would be able to clone the code into their 
          own document and then paste it back into Github as an updated version of code. The rest of the team members would also be notified as to what changes have been made 
          and by who. Some digital projects may require coding and for that some may use the Visual Studio Code software. This is a software that runs extensions such as Python
          in order for people to programme things such as text based games, creating websites and developing Artificial Intelligence. Teams may also need something similar to 
          a notice board so each member can keep track of where the project is up to and what else needs doing. Trello is a service that covers this aspect as it allows users 
          to create a task board that everyone can access from different devices. The user is able to create titles for their task columns such as ‘To Do’, ‘Doing’ and ‘Done’.
          This helps keep the project organised and on track.

      <h2> 1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control? </h2>
      <p> When me and my team were working one one of our digital projects we need software such as Slack and Trello. Slack benefited us quite a lot as it made it much easier for
          the team members to contact each other and share things such as text, images and code. Trello was also very useful because before we started our project we had to list
          out our task in the order that we needed to complete them and assigned them to certain team members. By doing this we found the project much more organised and easier to
          track. This is because I can keep the team updated with tasks and progress through the Trello board by creating several lists with sub-headings such as ‘To Do’ and ‘Done’,
          any changes made can be seen on every users screen and they are also updated via email. We used Visual Studio Code and Python to write our code out in order to create a
          text based fantasy game. The software allowed us to code whatever features we wanted to into the game such as fighting, character health levels and defence level for example.
      </p>
      <h2> 1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects? </h2>
      <p>
           The General Data Protection Regulation protects individuals as it is a way to ensure their information is protected. Websites must comply to GDPR laws especially when they are dealing with sensitive customer information such as card details, house address and email/passwords. The GDPR law was introduced in April 2016 in order to replace the 1995 Data Protection Directive [2]. The main aim of this law is to ensure that data all over Europe is protected properly. The websites have to comply by this law because they process most of the words data including information that if in the wrong hands someone’s identity can be stolen and fraudulent actions can be committed.
