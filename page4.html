      <h2> UNIT 1, OUTCOME 3</h2>
      <h2>  3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h2>
      <p> The benefits of the IT tools and systems that I used were that they were developed in order for productivity and dedicated to projects similar to mine. With Visual Studio Code the user is able to run several different languages such as Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS and much more. The only drawback about Visual Studio Code that would come to my mind is the fact that it doesn’t have a cloud saving function or something similar. I have experienced the struggle myself in this scenario as if I work on two different laptops. The way I used to share my code with my home laptop is by using Github. This is another IT tool that was extremely beneficial throughout the process. The benefit of Github is that I could upload code to it and access it from home, also vice versa. If you’re working professionally it would cost you to use the versioning repository on GitHub. The benefits of Trello is that it helps the user keep track of where they are up to with their work easily. A disadvantage is that sometimes the user my forget to look it at so I would suggest some sort of notification system to remind the user of tasks.

    <h2> 3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency </h2>
    <p> Productivity and efficiency would increase heavily if I was working with a team as I did everything by myself. If I had a team to work with we could each cover a certain section and dedicate ourselves to it. This would have saved a lot of time and effort throughout the project. Another way we could improve productivity and efficiency is be looking or new IT tools that would help and benefit us indifferent ways to the tools we have now.</p>
    <br>
    <h2> 3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h2>
    <p> Next time I would definitely get a team together and delegate tasks related to specific sections to each of them. This would improve efficiency and also a team brings more ideas to the table than an individual. Another benefit of having team members is that when one person is stuck with a problem they can work together to solve it. The amount of time that it would take to finish the project would reduce significantly as there is more than one person working on it so it would at least half the work time. When working with a team communication is vital and without this the team will go through many issues and errors. To resolve this issue I would advise using Slack. This enables the team members to create a channel where they can message each other, share images, hyperlinks or they can even message other team members individually in private chat. When it comes to sharing code I would advise Github as this is dedicated to making code sharing in teams easy.</p>
    <br>
    <h2> 3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions </h2>
    <p> In order to test the digital solutions that the team come up with we would run the code in Visual Studio Code to see if it runs properly first. The next step after this is to check all the buttons and functions work properly. Then the text needs ensuring it is the right size, colour and font. When testing the projects and digital solutions we have to act in a user’s point of view and act/respond how they would. If there are any issues or errors we would investigate to find out where the error is and resolve it as together. Again, quicker than someone would do if they were working on their own.</p>
