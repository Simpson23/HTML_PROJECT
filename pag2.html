<H2> 1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page</H2>
<p> 
  The colour theme for my website is Green and Orange as you may have noticed by the text and the font that I used is called ‘Bangers’. I used this font combined with this colour theme in order to create a cartoon/ whacky characters. I added on to this them by adding multiple GIF animations to some of my pages relating to the topic on that page. Each page is dedicated to its own section of questions and images in order for the reader to find it easier to read. I also added a title animation from my homepage on some of the other pages with less content as they were looking empty and lacking in some content because that section didn’t have as many questions. I added a menu bar under my title in order for the reader to navigate through my website easier and quicker.

<h2> 1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites </h2>
<p> Websites can’t take someone else's work and use it as their own as this comes under copyright. This can include videos, pictures, text and even software. 
    If someone wanted to use another individual’s work then they would have to ask for permission. In some cases the copyright owner may even demand some sort
     of payment to use their work. In the instance that permission is not granted and the website owner still uses the work then they are breaking the law by 
     breaching the copyright act. By breaking this law they are in a position where they can be fined and prosecuted in court.

<h2> 1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that
    people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them? </h2>
<p> When it comes to the individuals that may have some sort of disability there could be different struggles that each are going through. One way of resolving
    this method could be to program a voice controlling extension into the website. This would be beneficial for the people that struggle to type or manoeuvre
    the mouse. If they need further assistance I advise adding an ‘Easy mode’, this is where the website’s writing and icons become larger so they are more visible
    and multiple choice options are given so it is easier for the individual to do what they need to do. Also when they are presented with an option their device
    will read out text and following options out loud to them.
</p>
<h2> 1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites </h2>
<p> In order to create a website the programme has to run in a certain version, HTML. We can code HTML in Visual Studio (VS) Code and CSS. In VS Code the base of 
    the website is developed, for example, the title, the header, the images, the text or the sub-titles. In CSS, the websites design and visual attributes are modified, 
    for example, the user can change the colour, add themes or even change the font. Another filetype that may be included in websites are images. 
    These can come in different formats such as .gif, .png or .jpeg. To add in image it must be downloaded and then coded in instead of using a hyperlink in the code,
     this is so if the website or image gets deleted we can still use it on our website.
